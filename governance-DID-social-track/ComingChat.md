## Project Description

Committed to being a lifestyle tool in the era of ***web3*** and ***AI***, ComingChat is bridging ***Web3*** and ***ChatGPT***.
At the same time, ComingChat is also a mobile social tool that uses Sui Network as the web3 background and integrates various product functions.
We have developed the following Sui network based product features:
- ***Sui mobile wallet***: There are a total of 4 million ComingChat users on IOS and Android.
- [***DMens***](https://dmens-app.coming.chat/): The combination of "on-chain twitter" based on the Sui network and ChatGPT can help Sui build a value community platform on which you can enjoy the intelligent distribution of content on the chain.
- ***GPTBot***: Provides customization of GPT chatbots in various roles through the Sui network as a payment channel.
- ***[RedPacket](https://github.com/coming-chat/sui-red-packet)***: A red packet social app that combines private chat and encrypted wallet on Sui.

In addition, we have also developed the mobile Stake function of the Sui node, and a chat social robot based on the Sui network and ChatGPT. More social elements based on the Sui network are also being developed, so that Sui community users can enjoy the fun of web3 & AI social networking at the same time.
