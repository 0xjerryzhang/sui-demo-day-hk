### Project Website

Degenhive is accessible at https://degenhive.com/

### Primary Contact

Email - rahulmittal@astrotechlabs.com

### GitHub Repository

We haven't yet open-sourced our repository containing move modules, but we intend to do so as before we go live on mainnet (along-with SUI mainnet launch)

## Project Description

DegenHive aims to create a DeFi-powered social platform designed for traders, gamers, and investors, enabling users to create personalized digital avatars with interactive features.

### Version 1 Highlights:

Our v1 release includes a feature-rich DEX governed by soulbound NFTs, granting users access to a portion of the SUI token-flow generated from exchange fees.

### Live v1 Features:

1. A robust Decentralized Exchange offering concentrated liquidity (Curve v2), stableswap (Curve v1), and weighted pools (Balancer) for 2, 3, or 4 token pools, with price oracle support.
2. Non-transferable DegenHiveWallet NFTs that store users' time-adjusted LP contributions as HivePoints and tradable/lendable HivePass NFTs. Wallet NFT ownership benefits include:

- Protocol governance power
- Regular SUI token-flow from a share of exchange fees
- Access to AI features like GPT-powered HiveChat for user queries (portfolio & developer mode)

The DEX functionality is accessible at https://www.degenhive.wtf/, with the frontend for DegenHiveWallet-related functions under development and expected to be live in 2-3 weeks. Smart contracts are nearing audit readiness.
