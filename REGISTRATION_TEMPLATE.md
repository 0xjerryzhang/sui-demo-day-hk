## Project Description

Shiba Shiba Doge is a free-to-play online multiplayer social deduction game powered by Chainge Games. The game prioritizes playability and is accessible to everyone, crypto and non-crypto, with the support of an MPC wallet solution and multichain approach. Everyone can seamlessly play the game and earn via trading in-game items. Each person will explore the virtual game world as either a Shiba Inu ("good guy"), Doge ("killer"), or Shiba Inu lookalikes (“neutrals”). Each team has specific objectives to achieve in order to win the game.
