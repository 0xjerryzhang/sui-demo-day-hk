## Project Description 
Y Labs is a metaverse world project, we want to build a Sui ecosystem metaverse like decentraland, and also want to invite projects to settle in our metaverse and you can customize exhibition hall by yourself so that members can connect wallet to register Domain,buy and sell their NFT and others like defi,swap,launchpad and so on. Second: we want to create a social game like Virtual life on Sui, that you can work hard to earn money or just act as a thief, or work as police to catch a thief, you can work as any job that you want to do in our metaverse. Third: you can use tools to create a game so that others can play it, and we will use snapshot to choose some of the game to add to our metaverse.
