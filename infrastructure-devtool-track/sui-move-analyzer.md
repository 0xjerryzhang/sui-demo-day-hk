## Project Description 

The sui-move-analyzer is a Visual Studio Code plugin based on move-analyzer improved for Move & Sui Move by MoveBit. Just now, we used this plugin in our dev member's daily work, and it's an alpha release.

## Features

Here are some of the features of the sui-move-analyzer Visual Studio Code extension. To see them, open a
Move source file (a file with a `.move` file extension) and:

- See Move keywords and types highlighted in appropriate colors.
- Comment and un-comment lines of code using the `âŒ˜/` shortcut on macOS (or the menu command *Edit >
  Toggle Line Comment*).
- Place your cursor on a delimiter, such as `<`, `(`, or `{`, and its corresponding delimiter --
  `>`, `)`, or `}` -- will be highlighted.
- As you type, Move keywords will appear as completion suggestions.
- If the opened Move source file is located within a buildable project (a `Move.toml` file can be
  found in one of its parent directories), the following advanced features will also be available:
  - compiler diagnostics
  - go to definition
  - go to type definition
  - go to references
  - type on hover
  - outline view showing symbol tree for Move source files
  - autocomplete
  - sui commands line tool
  - sui project template
  - inlay hint to variable/parameter/statement
  - auto reload move.toml when modified
  - supporting MSL
  - supporting parallel development of multiple projects under the same directory
