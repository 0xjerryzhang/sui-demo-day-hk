## Project Description 

**MovePad**- 
Built to help onboard the next set of users into the Web3 space, MovePad is the first gamified IDO Launchpad on the Move based ecosystems. Our goal is to help projects on Sui and Aptos raise capital while making sure our community members and investors stay protected and do not lose their funds to scams.

**Automated Security Toolkit**-
We're committed to creating a DeFi ecosystem with advanced and reliable security features. To achieve this, we aspire to develop an automated security toolkit with Token Lockers, Liquidity Lockers and Token Vesting. 

**Token Locker**- Core team locks their team tokens to show they are committed to the project for the long haul

**Liquidity Locker**- Transparent and secure locker features to lock their project's liquidity

**Token Vesting**- Effortlessly automate the distribution of project's customized vesting contract to investors or employees

Importance of these tools in the ecosystem
For Projects 
	An easy and affordable way to launch tokens
