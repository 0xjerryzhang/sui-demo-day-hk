## Project Description

Walless is the first web3 sandbox-wallet with embedded dApps, simplified onboarding, unified cross-chain interface.

Walless is a comprehensive and innovative web3 wallet solution that caters to both end-users and developers. Our non-custodial wallet simplifies onboarding with social account logins and offers a user-centric unified layout for a seamless experience for new web3 users. Additionally, our embedded dApp sandbox allows for endless possibilities for building on our platform and enables web2 apps to onboard to the world of web3. With this approach, Walless has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about crypto wallets.

With that in mind, we're [open source](https://github.com/cocrafts/walless) from day one!
